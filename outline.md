## Intro
* Front end framework

* What is / isn't Angular  

"AngularJS fits the definition of a framework the best, even though it's much more lightweight than a typical framework and that's why many confuse it with a library." (angular faq)

* What angular can do and what it's good for
    * Great making sites fast (some say "responsive" but that's confusing with "responsive design")

    * Personally like it for organization
